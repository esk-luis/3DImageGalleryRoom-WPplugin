3D Image Gallery Room:

An experimental image gallery with a realistic touch. The images are displayed in a 3D room with walls.

This is my very first Wordpress plugin experience. Thus I took an existing WP plugin jQuery Slider (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jquery-slider/) and used it as a plugin template.

You can use it on your post or page using schortcode `[Image Gallery Room]` or in your template file  using php function `<?php if(function_exists('imageGalleryRoom')){ imageGalleryRoom(); } ?>`.
